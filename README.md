- Install OBS

    The first step is to download the software of course. 

    - System Requirements

        Windows:

        - DirectX 10.1 compatible GPU
        - Windows 8 / 8.1 / 10

        MacOS:

        - Intel CPU (PPC is not supported)
        - OpenGL 3.3 compatible GPU
        - macOS High Sierra (10.13) or later

        Linux/Unix

        - OpenGL 3.3 compatible GPU
        - X window system
- Setting up OBS and how to add scenes & sources

    Okay so here things might look complex but don't worry it's not that hard.(So I say).                  If you're new to OBS or just want to get started as quickly as possible, follow the steps to get good starting settings for your setup. If you only see the main OBS Studio window, you can access the Auto-Config Wizard in the Tools menu at the top. This wizard will automatically test your system and attempt to find settings that your PC can handle. This includes streaming or recording, resolution, bitrate, encoder, streaming provider and more. You can always modify the settings manually later.

    - What are scenes and how to add them?

        Scenes, on the other hand, are video canvases that are made up of one or more visual (and audio) elements from those sources.
